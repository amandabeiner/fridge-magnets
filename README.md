#Get Set Up

A React web app built as part of Launch Academy's Ship It Saturday hackathon. The app makes a call to the Words API to retrieve a new word, which the user can then drag around to make fridge poetry.

This app was built using AJAX, Words API, and Mashape authentication.

## Setup
To get set up, run the following commands:

```sh
$ npm install
$ webpack-dev-server
```
